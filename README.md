Hello, my name is Nathan. I am a computer engineering student at UCSD with an interest in high performance computing, machine learning, and development tools. You can find all of my projects here. I also have a [blog](www.nathom.dev) where I write about things that interest me. 

As of August 2023, I am an intern at Yahoo working on development tools and screwdriver-cd.
