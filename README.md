Hello, my name is Nathan. I am a computer engineering student at UCSD with an interest in high performance computing, machine learning, and development tools. You can find all of my projects here. I also have a [blog](www.nathom.dev) where I write about things that interest me. 

As of January 2024, I'm doing a M.S. in ML/AI at UCSD with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept.
